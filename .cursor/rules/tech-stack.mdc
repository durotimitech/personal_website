# Rule: Use Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion

## Match
.*

## Technology
- Use **Next.js** as the frontend framework with the **App Router** (not Pages Router).
- All pages and components should be structured using the **`app/` directory** format.

## Language
- Use **TypeScript** across the entire project. No JavaScript files should be used.

## Styling
- Use **TailwindCSS** exclusively for styling.
- Do not use plain CSS files, CSS modules, or styled-components.

## Animation
- Use **Framer Motion** for all animations and transitions.
- Avoid using CSS transition classes or vanilla JavaScript animations.

## Project Structure
- Organize components under a `components/` directory with a clear naming convention.
- Keep logic modular and reusable.
- Prefer server components when possible unless interactivity requires client components.

## Notes
- You can optionally add `shadcn/ui` for ready-made components styled with Tailwind.
- For forms or animations, `react-hook-form` and `zod` may also be used.
