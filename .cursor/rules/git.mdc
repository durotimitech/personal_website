**When:** I give you a command that starts with `commit "` or `push "` and ends with a closing quote, like `commit "feat: add new login component"`.

**Then:**
1.  **Extract the commit message.** The message is the text between the double quotes.

2.  **Execute the following shell commands in sequence:**
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "{message}"` (where `{message}` is the extracted commit message from step 1).
    <!-- * `git push` -->

3. Fix all build or lint errors

4.  **Report the outcome.** Let me know if the commands were executed successfully or if any of them failed. Show me the output from the `git push` command.
